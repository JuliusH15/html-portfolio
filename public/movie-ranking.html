<h1>The Best Movies According To Julius</h1>
 
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Excellent combination of stylish action, philosophy and sci fi.  I don't think any movie will ever replace this as number 1.</p>

<br>

<h3>John Wick Chapter 4</h3>
<p>I loved the fight choreography, the world building and thought the movie had good pacing despite being 3 hours long.</p>

<br>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>A very good complex thought provoking sci fi film.</p>
